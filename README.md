ROJO Coin Core Integration Repository
=====================================

ROJO Coin (ROJO) is 100% decentralized P2P cryptocurrency that delivers ease of use along with a fast, secure and anonymous network hosted on Masternodes globally. As a result of its decentralization, no central organization or entity controls ROJO Coin. The core dev team of ROJO are simply members of the ROJO Community who believe professionalism, integrity and quality are the 3 pillars of a strong cryptocurrency. ROJO differentiates itself from other cryptocurrencies by providing a fast, secure and stable platform to grow mass adoption globally. ROJO is able to ensure that coin holders may store, send and receive coins anonymously and securely through the use of both desktop and mobile wallets.

ROJO Coin has been built as a modified fork of PIVX and has kept sustainability top-of-mind with ROJO being a 100% Proof of Stake Masternode currency. At just 60 seconds, block times are 10x faster than parent coin Bitcoin, without having the negative environmental impact of high energy POW mining.

ROJO Coin is a modified Masternode currency. ROJO Coin separates itself through longevity supporting coin specifications, customized QT wallets, explicit Masternode and POS wallet block rewards and an intentionally low maximum coin supply of 25,000,000 ROJO Coins. Block Rewards halve every 1,000,000 blocks per 1,388 days until the maximum total supply of 25 million ROJO Coins is reached in 100+ years.
